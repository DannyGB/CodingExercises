FizzBuzz
========

This is a .Net Core console application, it has no external dependencies

This is a coding exercise to create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

The output for the numbers 1 to 15 would be:

`1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz`
